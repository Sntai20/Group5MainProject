## QueryRunner
A simple Java Database Calls (JDBC) Application to query the clinical lab management database.

### Description
QueryRunner takes a list of Queries that are initialized in it's constructor
and provides functions that will call the various functions in the QueryJDBC class
which will enable MYSQL queries to be executed. It also has functions to provide the
returned data from the Queries. Currently, the eventHandlers in QueryFrame call these
functions in order to run the Queries.
